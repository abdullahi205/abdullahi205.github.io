    <p>One most delicious meat stake, it has amazing nutrient and very rich with protein</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 beef steaks, about 3/4 inch thick (porterhouse, rib eye, sirloin or T-bone steaks) or about 1 inch thick (tenderloin steaks)</li>
        <li>1  tea spoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the coals or a gas grill for direct heat. Heat to medium heat, which will take about 40 minutes for charcoal or about 10 minutes for a gas grill.</li>
        <li>Cut outer edge of fat on steaks (except tenderloin steaks) diagonally at 1-inch intervals with a sharp knife. Do not cut into the meat because it will allow the juices to cook out and the beef will become dry.</li>
        <li>Place the beef on the grill rack over medium heat. Cover the grill; cook 6 to 8 minutes for rib eye, 10 to 12 minutes for porterhouse and T-bone or 13 to 15 minutes for sirloin and tenderloin, turning beef once halfway through cooking, until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted in center of thickest part reads 145°F for medium-rare or 160°F for medium doneness. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
